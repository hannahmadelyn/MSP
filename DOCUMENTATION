Please follow the below (and add rules as we go) for consistent programming:



- Comment code accurately, if another team member looks at your work they should be able to understand it reasonably easily. 



- Naming conventions: 

      Varibale: dateAdded 

      Table names: all caps: ITEMS 

      Functions: btnSubmit  (e.g NOT submitButton) - list action first
